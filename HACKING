In-Place Development
====================

Tuke uses some native C modules which need to be compiled before use. setup.py
uses setup tools, so the correct command sequence is the following:

mkdir build
export PYTHONPATH=build

Then after every change to a native C module:

./setup.py develop -d build

Unittests
=========

To run all unit tests:

./tuke test

For other options:

./tuke test --help

Examples
========

Currently one example is usable:

cd examples
./led_grid 10 10 10x10 && gerbv 10x10.*

Creates a 10x10 series-parallel led grid.

You can also leave off the gerber output prefix to see the Python code for that
grid:

./led_grid 10 10
