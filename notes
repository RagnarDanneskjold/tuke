some quick ideas:

programmable heavy symbol generator


make sure there are nice ways to map symbolic pin names to numerical pin numbers

make embedded symbols/footprints be default, with uuid? sha1?

note licencing of symbols/footprints for above usage


think about usage of multi-slot parts, should be easy to assign slots to parent parts, as well as move them around


pcb ui should allow parts to be temp placed off board

tooltips


remove concept of "Vcc solder" etc. replace with configurable Vcc/GND connected net colors


need physical keepouts, electrical keepouts, top.solder.keepout? top.phys.keepout?

IPC-7351 - the big spec for smd stuff



Layer ideas:

layer.type

layer - Physically/Logically seperate. Differently named layers must not affect
each other in any way. top is independent of bottom

type - Sub types in the same physical space.


*.drill - drill layer, present in all layers at once
top.drill - drill through top layer only
(top|middle).drill - drill through top and middle only


pin connection syntax:

link(p1,p2)

cut(p1,p2)
