Purpose
=======

Tuke is a Python library that aims to make it easy to write programs that
generate schematics and assocated pcb layout. A simple example is a large LED
grid. With Tuke, instead of manually creating the (large) schematic and then
manually laying out the grid, you would write Python code that defined the
components, netlist, and finally physical position of the footprints and traces
on the board. This can be done once, so that if any aspect of the design
changes, it's a simple matter of rerunning the program rather than manually
changing a 16x32 led grid to a 24x48 grid.

Project Files & Directories
===========================

* README: You're reading it.

* COPYING: GPL-3 license that Tuke is placed under

* doc: Very rough documentation currently.

  - doc/experiments: Various coding experiments.

* examples: Various Tuke using examples:

  - led_grid: Create a x*y led grid. Kept up to date with the latest
    implemented features and as a way to help guide the design.

* Tuke: Source code for the Tuke module.

The Name
========

The following Python expression was used to choose the name of Tuke:

lambda n,i: [reduce(lambda a,b: a + b,[random.sample(map(lambda x: chr(ord('a') + x),range(26)),1)[0] for c in range(n)]) for t in range(i)]

Where n=4, i=1000

Followed by checking Google, apt-get and Freshmeat for conflicts. I highly
suggest this procedure, although, for smaller projects increasing n may be
appropriate. Small phrases obtained from the Google search may prove to be more
memorable as well, such as my solenoid controller board, 'Post-Napoleonic
Europe' and it's associated Python class, 'QuadrupleAlliance'
