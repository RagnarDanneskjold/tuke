http:/cbold.com <- kinda like tuke, but doesn't do the physical side of things

-we should do things like this, Tuke is for developers!

-also, links to the above and talks about testing

cypthon <- "python" compiled to c

some quick ideas:


programmable heavy symbol generator


make embedded symbols/footprints be default, with uuid? sha1?

note licencing of symbols/footprints for above usage


think about usage of multi-slot parts, should be easy to assign slots to parent parts, as well as move them around


pcb ui should allow parts to be temp placed off board

tooltips


remove concept of "Vcc solder" etc. replace with configurable Vcc/GND connected net colors


need physical keepouts, electrical keepouts, top.solder.keepout? top.phys.keepout?

IPC-7351 - the big spec for smd stuff



Layer ideas:

layer.type

layer - Physically/Logically seperate. Differently named layers must not affect
each other in any way. top is independent of bottom

type - Sub types in the same physical space.


*.drill - drill layer, present in all layers at once
top.drill - drill through top layer only
(top|middle).drill - drill through top and middle only


Translate/Rotate/LayerSwap -> Transform

pin connection syntax:

link(p1,p2)

cut(p1,p2)


need to have a Bus Component, with named pins for various lines in the bus:

i2c = Bus() # or even, i2c_Bus()

self.link(i2c.scl,obj.scl)
self.link(i2c.sda,obj.sda)

can we extend link to link busses?

self.link(i2c,obj.i2c)
self.link(pwr,obj.pwr)

What about having sub objects, in subs, be allowed to be a accessed via .obj
where obj is the sub-objects Id? Then pin's and busses could be completely
generalized, with the bus being a collection of pins.

link could be setup so that only like stuff can be linked, with the link
objects handling the link ability. Of course you can always link up the
individual pins manually.

To handle net attributes link should have an optional third arg, attrib, which
normally is simply copied from first to second. (or maybe more restrictive to
less) Or just error if net types are different. They could simply be
implemented by sub-classing Pin


Multi-part components like op-amps can be treated like busses:

opamp.slota.in
opamp.slota.out
opamp.slotb.in

Need to be able to exchange slots as well. Maybe a MultiSlot class, with a
seperate Slot class, and play games with the connectivity, or heck, even just
do delete/rename/recreate's when you want to exchage two slots.


For debugging Elements should include a reference to what source code file
instanciated them.
